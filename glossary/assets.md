# Assets

The Stellar distributed network can be used to track, hold, and transfer any type of **asset**: dollars, euros, bitcoin, stocks, gold, and other tokens of value. Any asset on the network can be traded and exchanged with any other using Stellar's built-in [decentralized exchange](decentralized-exchange.md).

For more information on assets, see the [Anatomy of an Asset](../issuing-assets/anatomy-of-an-asset.md) in the [Issue Assets](https://github.com/slideloft/new-docs/tree/046158a008b14dc6d54bdd6f4c48e078c303a05e/content/docs/issuing-assets/README.md) section of the docs.
