Some errors only occur at the Horizon level and are not thrown in Stellar Core. These are usually issues with how the transaction was formed or a conflict between the transactionâ€™s composition and how the Horizon server is setup.

Stellar uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general:

* Codes in the 2xx range indicate success.
* Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided
* Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with the Horizon server.

There are two types of Status Codes: [Standard Status Codes](standard.md) and [Horizon-Specific Status Codes](https://github.com/slideloft/new-docs/tree/046158a008b14dc6d54bdd6f4c48e078c303a05e/content/api/errors/http-status-codes/horizon-specific.mdx).
