# Welcome

**Getting Started**

Welcome to the Bantu Developer's Documentation. It contains everything required for developers to get started with Building and integrating their apps with Bantu.

**What is Bantu** The Bantu blockchain combines speed, security, reliability and includes human elements of fairness and sharing to empower participants on the network while lowering the entry barriers for participation. Many of the well-known blockchains, for all their popularity, have mostly benefited early adopters. We are changing that narrative and we are set to become a conduit for positive socio-economic impact in the emerging economies around the world.

**Quick rundown of whats here:**

**Tutorials:**

This section will show you how to do basic things like create an account and make payments.

**Issue Assets:**

You can issue assets easily on Bantu, and it can be done with few lines of code safely. You can also publish information about your asset for Wallets and consumers, control access to it by setting simple flags, and make it available for trade on the Bantu decentralized exchange

**Anchor Assets**

 Organizations can connect assets issued on Bantu with external banking and payment systems, allowing users and businesses to transfer assets onto or through the Bantu network. Specifically, organizations can anchor assets issued on the Bantu network by facilitating 1-1 trades for the off-chain representation of the tokenized asset.

**Build Apps**

 Bantu is a self-serve distributed ledger that you can use as a backend to power all kinds of apps and services. Any app built on Bantu relies on the same basic functions: key storage, account creation, transaction signing, and queries to the Bantu database. This section of the docs will walk you through the process of building a basic wallet that does all those things, and will show you how to add features to it like the support for in-app deposits and withdrawals from anchors.

**Run a Core Node** 

This section explains the technical and operational aspects of installing, configuring, and maintaining a Bantu Core node, which is a server that connects to the Bantu peer-to-peer network to keep a common distributed ledger. You donâ€™t have to run a node to get started on Bantu, but you will likely want to if you're in production, need high-availability access network, or want to help increase network health and decentralization.

**Run an API Server**

 Most developers access the network using Horizon, the Bantu API. It takes the performance-oriented data structures from Bantu Core and converts them into a friendlier format. If you're running your own Bantu Core node and using it to submit transactions or get network data, you will likely also want to run your own Horizon instance, and this section will show you how. If you're just looking to use Horizon \(vs. setting up a Horizon server\), consult the API Reference.

**Software and SDKs**

 This is where you'll find all the Bantu SDKs. There are a lot of them, and they're all pretty well maintained and documented, so you should be able to build on Bantu in your language of choice. This section is also home to some tools and reference implementations created and maintained by the Bantu Development Foundation to kickstart development.

**Glossary** 

This section defines all the terms and explains all the concepts germane to Bantu. Use it to look up a word, or to dig deeper into nitty-gritty details.[Read More](https://bantu-foundation.gitbook.io/bantu-blockchain-foundation/glossary)
